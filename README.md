# Total War: Warhammer II Talent Calculator

This is a talent calculator I created for a game I enjoy playing: Total War: Warhammer II. Suprisingly enough nothing like this exists on the internet. This project aims to rememdy that.

## Getting Started

You'll need:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/) I recommend this if using a Windows system

1. Clone the repository to your desired location
2. Start the client and the server (you must be in the corrosponding folder):

```
#client
npm run serve

#server
npm start
```

Now you can view the current state of the website by going to http://localhost:8080
